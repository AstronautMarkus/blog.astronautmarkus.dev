Greetings! Welcome to my AstronautMarkus Blog repository. In this repository, I will publish my personal IT experiences, tutorials, and insights on various technology topics.

This blog is not meant to be a 'community', but rather a 'notebook' where I can upload tutorials or information that might be useful, like it would be useful to my 'past self', and perhaps it would be useful to you too.

If you're interested, you can visit the URL when everything's ready: **[https://blog.astronautmarkus.dev/](https://blog.astronautmarkus.dev/)**

> **📝 Language Note:** Initially, all content will be published in English due to time constraints. Spanish content will be added later as I expand the blog.
